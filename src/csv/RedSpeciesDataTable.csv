Agrimonia eupatoria,,Extinct, Common Agrimony,L. (1753),Rosaceae,Mediterranean,"Euro-Siberian (Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian)","Amud stream (Nahal Amud), Saar river (Friendship Bridge to Qiniye Spring)",1,EX    ,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,"A perennial herb up to 100 cm tall. It has a lifespan of approximately 5-10 years. Its shoots develop from rhizomes. The stems are erect and hairy. Its leaves are pinnate, with large crenulated leaflets that have a green upper side and an underside covered in whitish hairs . Its foliage and leaves resemble a dwarf Rhus coriaria (Elm Leaved Sumach or Tanner Sumach ) from afar.  In the spring the stems lengthen and carry many long densely flowered spikes. Each yellow-orange flower is about 1 cm across, with five petals. There are five to twelve stamens that rise above the flower cup and face boldly upwards towards the light.  When ripening the calyx hangs down and is covered in long hairs. it becomes rather woody and is thickly covered at the end with bristly long hairs that spread and develop into a burr-like form...  The top of the calyx is bordered with hard curved spines. The pollination method is unknown. The fruit is a nutlet hidden inside the hard calyx. Long-distance fruit dispersal is effective: the spiny fruit attaches easily to the fur of animals and to socks. ",: In European folk medicine – as a cure for liver complaints. Was once used to prepare a yellow dye.,Was once found in the upper Amud stream in the Upper Galilee and in the Sa'ar Stream on the edge of Mt. Hermon and the Golan Heights . It was first collected in Israel in the 1920s by Noah Naftolsky and by Alexander Eig and Michael Zohary in the Upper Amud stream. Since then it has not been seen there and is probably extinct. It was collected at the foot of Mount Hermon in 1983 in the water channel near the Sa'ar Stream near Qiniye Spring but has not been found there since 1990.,"Stream banks and springs, in wet hollows with pure clear water at the edges of woods, on mountains above 600 meters.","In the Euro-Siberian, Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian areas. This is a widely distributed species, and its range includes all of Europe, the northern Mediterranean countries, Central and West Asia to China.  The common agrimony grows in Europe in damp habitats not necessarily connected to water bodies, such as hollows or open sub-forests. In the Levant – Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus – on the other hand, it grows only near water bodies. The subspecies found in Israel grows in Europe and the Mediterranean countries and penetrates into West Asia up to the Caucasus and Zagros Mountains.","This is a northern genus, which includes 15 species growing in northern temperate parts of the globe (North America, Europe and Africa).  The genus belongs to the group of genera that characterizes the Euro-Siberian region. In our area there is no other species of Agrimonia. In Israel the common agrimony is an extreme southern representative of the distinct northern group that is associated with intense humidity and summer rains. Consequently in Israel it is found only near springs or streams in cool areas.","1.  Wetland habitats and natural water pools are rare in the mountainous parts of Israel. The destruction of spring and flowing stream habitats in the mountains are a major threat. Picking attractiveness is moderate. 2. The species has a fragmented distribution and is found at two sites, in different regions. Its distribution throughout the Levant and in Cyprus is fragmented as well. 3.The population found in the Sa'ar Stream in 1983 numbered 3 individuals. The population size found in the upper Amud stream in the 1920s was estimated at 10-100 individuals.4.The common agrimony is a typical example of a northern plant, relatively common in Europe, whose populations become smaller and more limited to moist habitats in the southern parts of its range. Therefore, at the edge of its distribution in the Levant the threat is highest, unlike in Europe and Turkey, where the species is relatively common.We have no accurate map reference of the location in the upper Amud stream site, but it is probably found in the Mount Meron Nature Reserve","The species should be reintroduced to nature from sources in Lebanon or from botanical gardens to pools in flowing mountain streams – to the upper Amud stream, Meron Stream, Wadi Moran, Wadi Sarakh, Wadi Kziv and Sa’ar Stream whose flow will be rehabilitated and protected. If the populations will be naturalized they should be protected from trampling and collection. We recommend conducting a detailed survey in the spring to try and locate plants in the Sa'ar Stream, where they have not been seen since 1990.","This is a perennial herb that is extinct in Israel where it previously grew near water at two sites: in the Upper  Amud Stream and in the Sa'ar Stream. Its Red  characteristics are:  rarity, site fragmentation, being a northern peripheral species and the destruction of its rare habitat. It is recommended to renaturalize the species in places from which it has become extinct. ",
